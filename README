Compiling and Installation
The binaries for the native applications are included. You can also compile them from the source using the instructions from the resources given in the resource section.

Compiling instructions for the native applications will be added here soon.

To get the application running on your android phone -

Get the source
git clone http://git.umitproject.org/ns-mobile.git

From the android-sdk tools folder run -
android update project --name ns-mobile --target android-8 --path /path/to/source

And then from the project folder run 'ant release'.
The APK file will be generated in the bin folder. Install it on your device using adb install /path/to/apk

Note: you need zipalign on the PATH. Also you should configure the keystore in ant.properties.
Example @ UNIX
$ cd ~/.android
$ keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore -alias alias_name -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
create an ant.properties in root project with:
key.store=/Users/.username/my-release-key.keystore
key.alias=alias_name

Port Scanner executable
[Requires root privileges]

The native binary is copied automatically to /data/local/scanner when the program runs. 

Usage

Basic SYN Scan 
./scanner -s -h 192.168.2.1

Basic FIN Scan
./scanner -f -h 192.168.2.1

Additional options
-v Verbose mode
-p Set source port
-T set number of tries for timedout ports
-r Set packet rate
-N output for the apk to parse
